            <p>Introduction</p>
            <p>In the literature, the scenario in which the four newly-industrializing countries (NICs) - or newly industrialized economies (NIEs) - of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan experienced unmatched levels of economic growth is known as the East Asian miracle¹. The first time the expression was used to refer to a broad "Miracle" in East Asia was, at least in the West, in the article "Explaining the East Asian 'Miracle'" by McCord, published in 1989. From there, the World Bank published the controversial report "East Asian miracle: Economic growth and public policy" in 1993, which was followed by Krugman's critique on Foreign Affairs entitled "The myth of Asia's miracle"² and Kwon's rebuttal "The East Asia challenge to neoclassical orthodoxy"³, both published in 1994.</p>
