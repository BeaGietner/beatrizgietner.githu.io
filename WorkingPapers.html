        <h3>Cognitive and Noncognitive Factors in Educational Production</h3>
        <p>This is the first chapter of my thesis. It is pretty much still a work in progress, and preliminary results can be viewed <a href="ConflictingForces.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I keep a folder on <a href="https://github.com/BeaGietner/ConflictingForces" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with all the plots and graphs that I might end up adding to the final version.</p>
   <p>Abstract: This study examines how cognitive and noncognitive abilities jointly influence
academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary students, with a
focus on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal
study, I apply linear and translog production functions to model these relationships.
The results reveal that cognitive abilities are the strongest predictors of academic
performance for all students, with a slightly stronger correlation observed for male
students. Noncognitive factors, particularly Focused Behavior and Conscientiousness, also contribute significantly, especially for female students in Maths. The
interaction between cognitive and noncognitive factors varies by subject: in Maths,
they tend to complement each other, while in English, one can more easily compensate for the other. However, there is a limit to how much noncognitive abilities can
make up for cognitive skills, with behavioral skills offering more flexibility than
personality traits. The study also uncovers diminishing returns as students develop
their abilities, particularly in English. These findings suggest that educational strategies targeting both cognitive and noncognitive development, tailored to gender and
subject-specific needs, may be more effective in addressing academic achievement
gaps. The results also highlight the importance of considering whether noncognitive
measures represent changeable behaviors or more stable personality traits when
designing educational interventions.
