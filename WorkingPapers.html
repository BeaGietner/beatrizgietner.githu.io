   <p>Abstract: This study investigates the combined impact of cognitive and noncognitive abilities on academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study, linear and translog production functions are applied to model these relationships. The findings show that cognitive abilities are the most influential predictors of academic performance across all students, with a slightly stronger correlation observed in male students. Noncognitive factors, particularly Focused Behavior and Conscientiousness, also play a significant role, especially for female students in Maths. The interaction between cognitive and noncognitive factors differs by subject: in Maths, they often complement each other, while in English, one can more easily compensate for the other. However, the ability of noncognitive skills to offset cognitive limitations has its limits, with behavioral skills providing greater flexibility than personality traits. The study also reveals diminishing returns in ability development, particularly in English. These results suggest that educational strategies that address both cognitive and noncognitive development, tailored to gender and subject-specific needs, may be more effective in narrowing academic achievement gaps. Additionally, the findings emphasize the need to consider whether noncognitive measures reflect changeable behaviors or more stable personality traits when designing educational interventions.</p>    
          <h3>Decomposing the Gender Achievement Gap</h3>

    <p> Abstract: This paper examines gender achievement gaps in Maths and English among Irish students using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study. I employing the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method to analyze how cognitive abilities, non-cognitive traits, and socioeconomic factors contribute to these gaps. The findings reveal persistent gender-based patterns in academic achievement that vary by subject and socioeconomic status. Boys consistently outperform girls in Maths, though this gap is smaller in higher-income households and when the primary caregiver has higher education. On the other hand, girls demonstrate superior performance in English, with this advantage amplifying in households where caregivers have higher education levels. The decomposition analysis shows that cognitive factors, particularly numerical and verbal reasoning, tend to narrow gender achievement gaps, while certain non-cognitive traits like Hyperactivity/Inattention and Conscientiousness often work to widen them. With respect to socioeconomic effects, higher household income and primary caregiver education tend to narrow the Maths gap, secondary caregiver education appears to widen it. In English, higher parental education levels are associated with larger gaps favoring girls, suggesting differential returns to family background by gender and subject. These findings contribute to our understanding of human capital formation and the economics of education, with implications for addressing educational inequalities and optimizing skill development.</p>

        <h3>Shadow Education Policies and Outcomes in East Asia: A Comparative Analysis (2009-2023)</h3>
        <p>This research project investigates the dynamic landscape of shadow education systems across East Asia from 2009 to 2023. Focusing on five key countries - South Korea, Japan, China, Singapore, and Hong Kong - the study examines how various policy approaches have shaped educational outcomes and equity in the region. 
            Shadow education, also known as private supplementary tutoring, has become a pervasive phenomenon in East Asian education systems. This parallel education sector operates alongside mainstream schooling and has profound implications for educational equity, student well-being, and overall academic performance. By analyzing the diverse policy approaches adopted by different countries, such as South Korea's hagwon curfew and China's recent ban on for-profit tutoring, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of various regulatory strategies.
            My research utilizes data from international standardized tests, specifically the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), to measure student achievement consistently across countries and time. Employing a difference-in-differences approach, the study leverages the staggered implementation of shadow education policies to identify causal effects on educational outcomes.
            Key research questions include: a) How do different regulatory approaches to shadow education affect student academic performance and educational equity? b) To what extent does the growth of online tutoring platforms influence the effectiveness of traditional shadow education policies? c) How do the effects of shadow education policies vary across different socioeconomic groups, and what are the implications for educational inequality? This project also explores the rapid growth of online tutoring platforms, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the shadow education landscape. By examining these changes, the study aims to provide insights into how policy changes have affected access to education and outcomes across different socioeconomic groups. The findings of this research have the potential to inform future policy decisions not only in East Asia but also globally, as other countries increasingly look to East Asian education systems as models. Through this comprehensive analysis, the study seeks to contribute to our understanding of the role and evolution of shadow education in high-performing education systems and its implications for educational equity and student achievement.</p>
        <h3>Shinsai Go: Educational and Economic Repercussions of the Great East Japan Earthquake</h3>
<p>The Great East Japan Earthquake, as it's also known, was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan's history, causing widespread destruction and long-lasting socioeconomic effects, particularly in the Tōhoku region. This study aims to examine how such catastrophic event affected high school graduation rates, university enrollment patterns, and youth employment trends in the most severely impacted prefectures compared to less affected areas of Japan. This research focuses on a 5-7 year period following the disaster, addressing a crucial gap in our understanding of the medium-term effects of major natural disasters on education and employment outcomes in developed countries. My proposed methodology employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights. The quantitative component includes difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis and regression models to compare affected and unaffected regions before and after the disaster. This will help isolate the earthquake's impact on various outcomes of interest, such as graduation rates, enrollment patterns, and employment types. The qualitative aspect involves document analysis of policy reports and, if possible, interviews with education officials, school administrators, teachers, and students. Data collection draws from various Japanese government sources, including the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japan Meteorological Agency. The study also gather s information on educational statistics, labor market indicators, economic recovery metrics, demographic data, and disaster impact measures. 
    The research questions address several key areas: a) the impact on high school graduation rates and university enrollment patterns, b) short-term and medium-term effects on youth unemployment and types of employment, c) correlation between changes in educational attainment and shifts in employment patterns, d) effectiveness of policy measures implemented in response to the disaster, and e) changes in the popularity of specific university majors or vocational training programs. This study is expected to make significant academic contributions by filling gaps in our understanding of medium-term disaster impacts, analyzing differential impacts based on disaster intensity, and integrating education and labor market outcomes. It also aims to provide valuable insights for policy development in areas such as education system resilience, targeted intervention strategies, labor market policies, and long-term disaster recovery planning. I plan to conduct my research during a short stay program at Tōhoku University, leveraging its location in Sendai, one of the areas significantly affected by the 2011 disaster. This positioning offers unique opportunities to gather firsthand insights and access local resources crucial to the study. By bridging the gap between immediate post-disaster studies and long-term impact assessments, this research seeks to provide crucial insights for enhancing societal resilience to natural disasters, particularly in the context of education and employment in developed countries prone to such catastrophic events.</p>
        <h3>Starting Behind to Get Ahead: A Critical Examination of Educational Redshirting Research</h3>
<p>This review project aims to synthesize and critically analyze existing research on the practice of academic redshirting, where parents deliberately delay their child's entry into formal schooling. This literature review will explore various aspects of educational redshirting, including: the prevalence and trends of redshirting across different demographics; short-term and long-term academic outcomes for redshirted children; socio-emotional impacts of delayed school entry; the relationship between redshirting and educational inequality; policy implications and debates surrounding the practice. By conducting this critical examination, I hope to provide a nuanced understanding of the current state of knowledge on educational redshirting, identify gaps in existing research, and offer insights for future studies and policy considerations in this area.</p>
