    <p>TL;DR: This study examines how both thinking abilities and behavioral traits affect Irish students' Maths and English performance. Cognitive abilities were the strongest predictor overall (especially for boys), while behavioral traits like focus and conscientiousness mattered significantly (especially for girls in Maths). While being "smart" matters most for school success, skills like focus and self-discipline also significantly impact gradesâ€”educational approaches should develop both while considering gender differences.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates the combined impact of cognitive and noncognitive abilities on academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, focusing on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study, linear and translog production functions are applied. Findings show cognitive abilities are the strongest predictors of academic performance, with slightly stronger effects for boys. Noncognitive factors, particularly Focused Behavior and Conscientiousness, also play a significant role, especially for girls in Maths. Results suggest addressing both cognitive and noncognitive development tailored to gender and subject-specific needs could narrow academic achievement gaps.</p>

    <h3>Decomposing the Gender Achievement Gap</h3>
    <p>Preliminary results can be viewed <a href="CogNonCogGenderGap.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>TL;DR: Among Irish students, boys show higher performance in Maths, while girls excel in English. Socioeconomic status influences these gaps, with wealthier families narrowing the Maths gap and amplifying girls' English advantage. Behavioral traits like attention and conscientiousness often amplify these gaps, fueling workplace segregation and doubling down on both gender and economic inequalities.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines gender achievement gaps in Maths and English among Irish students using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method is employed to analyze cognitive abilities, noncognitive traits, and socioeconomic factors. Boys outperform girls in Maths, though the gap narrows in higher-income households and with more educated primary caregivers. Girls excel in English, with this advantage amplifying in households with higher parental education. Cognitive factors narrow gender gaps, while behavioral traits like Hyperactivity/Inattention and Conscientiousness often widen them. Findings underscore the need to address educational inequalities and optimize skill development.</p>
