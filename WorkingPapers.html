   <p>TL;DR: The study examines how both thinking abilities and behavioral/personality traits affect Irish students' Maths and English performance. While cognitive abilities were the strongest predictor overall (especially for boys), behavioral traits like focus and conscientiousness also mattered significantly (especially for girls in Maths). In Maths, these abilities tend to work together, while in English, strength in one area can somewhat make up for weakness in another. The study shows that while being "smart" matters most for school success, skills like focus and self-discipline also significantly impact grades - and the best educational approaches should develop both, while considering gender differences in how these factors interact.</p>
        <p>Abstract: This study investigates the combined impact of cognitive and noncognitive abilities on academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study, linear and translog production functions are applied to model these relationships. The findings show that cognitive abilities are the most influential predictors of academic performance across all students, with a slightly stronger correlation observed in male students. Noncognitive factors, particularly Focused Behavior and Conscientiousness, also play a significant role, especially for female students in Maths. The interaction between cognitive and noncognitive factors differs by subject: in Maths, they often complement each other, while in English, one can more easily compensate for the other. However, the ability of noncognitive skills to offset cognitive limitations has its limits, with behavioral skills providing greater flexibility than personality traits. The study also reveals diminishing returns in ability development, particularly in English. These results suggest that educational strategies that address both cognitive and noncognitive development, tailored to gender and subject-specific needs, may be more effective in narrowing academic achievement gaps. Additionally, the findings emphasize the need to consider whether noncognitive measures reflect changeable behaviors or more stable personality traits when designing educational interventions.</p>    
          <h3>Decomposing the Gender Achievement Gap</h3>

   <p>TD;DR: Among Irish students, clear gender patterns emerge in academic achievement: boys show higher performance in Maths while girls excel in English. These gaps are influenced by socioeconomic status, with higher household income reducing the Maths gap and parental education amplifying females' English advantage. While cognitive abilities tend to narrow these gender gaps, behavioral traits such as attention levels and conscientiousness often amplify them. These gender gaps in early education likely fuel workplace segregation (like fewer women in STEM), while the influence of family wealth means we are likely doubling down on both gender and economic inequalities - wealthy families can better overcome these gender patterns, giving their children more career options and perpetuating social divides.</p>
        <p> Abstract: This paper examines gender achievement gaps in Maths and English among Irish students using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study. I employing the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method to analyze how cognitive abilities, non-cognitive traits, and socioeconomic factors contribute to these gaps. The findings reveal persistent gender-based patterns in academic achievement that vary by subject and socioeconomic status. Boys consistently outperform girls in Maths, though this gap is smaller in higher-income households and when the primary caregiver has higher education. On the other hand, girls demonstrate superior performance in English, with this advantage amplifying in households where caregivers have higher education levels. The decomposition analysis shows that cognitive factors, particularly numerical and verbal reasoning, tend to narrow gender achievement gaps, while certain non-cognitive traits like Hyperactivity/Inattention and Conscientiousness often work to widen them. With respect to socioeconomic effects, higher household income and primary caregiver education tend to narrow the Maths gap, secondary caregiver education appears to widen it. In English, higher parental education levels are associated with larger gaps favoring girls, suggesting differential returns to family background by gender and subject. These findings contribute to our understanding of human capital formation and the economics of education, with implications for addressing educational inequalities and optimizing skill development.</p>
