        <h3>Conflicting Forces: The role of positive and negative mechanisms in shaping educational outcomes</h3>
        <p>This is the first chapter of my thesis. It is pretty much still a work in progress, and preliminary results can be viewed <a href="ConflictingForces.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I keep a folder on <a href="https://github.com/BeaGietner/ConflictingForces" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with all the plots and graphs that I might end up adding to the final version.</p>
   <p>Abstract: Much has been said about cognition’s role in influencing children’s and young adults’ educational outcomes. However, there is a gap in the existing research regarding understanding the significance of noncognitive skills and behaviors in shaping these outcomes, especially when considering the variable gender. Although conclusions have been mixed, it is clear that multiple factors contribute to students’ performance on standardized tests, educational achievements, and future job success. Using data from the Growing Up In Ireland longitudinal study, I find that cognition is still the most important predictor of academic performance even when we consider both measures of noncognition (SDQ and TIPI scores) and after controlling for SES and school characteristics, with different magnitude effects for males and females. I then perform an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and find that while all cognitive measures are responsible, to different degrees, for closing the gender grade gap, noncognitive variables mostly widen the gap. I also find a high degree of heterogeneity when I break down cognition between genders for different scores of noncognitive variables, which implies that having high or low scores in noncognition can be positive or detrimental depending on how individuals score in cognition. I then perform a simulation exercise aiming at closing the gender grade gap by varying the noncognitive scores by one standard deviation.</p>
