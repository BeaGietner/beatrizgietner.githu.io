        <h3>Cognitive and Noncognitive Factors in Educational Production</h3>
        <p>This is the first chapter of my thesis. It is pretty much still a work in progress, and preliminary results can be viewed <a href="Chapter_1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I keep a folder on <a href="https://github.com/BeaGietner/ConflictingForces" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with all the plots and graphs that I might end up adding to the final version.</p>
   <p>Abstract: This study investigates the combined impact of cognitive and noncognitive abilities on academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study, linear and translog production functions are applied to model these relationships. The findings show that cognitive abilities are the most influential predictors of academic performance across all students, with a slightly stronger correlation observed in male students. Noncognitive factors, particularly Focused Behavior and Conscientiousness, also play a significant role, especially for female students in Maths. The interaction between cognitive and noncognitive factors differs by subject: in Maths, they often complement each other, while in English, one can more easily compensate for the other. However, the ability of noncognitive skills to offset cognitive limitations has its limits, with behavioral skills providing greater flexibility than personality traits. The study also reveals diminishing returns in ability development, particularly in English. These results suggest that educational strategies that address both cognitive and noncognitive development, tailored to gender and subject-specific needs, may be more effective in narrowing academic achievement gaps. Additionally, the findings emphasize the need to consider whether noncognitive measures reflect changeable behaviors or more stable personality traits when designing educational interventions.</p>

        <h3>Shinsai Go: Educational and Economic Repercussions of the Great East Japan Earthquake</h3>
<p>The Great East Japan Earthquake, as it's also known, was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan's history, causing widespread destruction and long-lasting socioeconomic effects, particularly in the Tōhoku region. This study aims to examine how such catastrophic event affected high school graduation rates, university enrollment patterns, and youth employment trends in the most severely impacted prefectures compared to less affected areas of Japan. The research focuses on a 5-7 year period following the disaster, addressing a crucial gap in our understanding of the medium-term effects of major natural disasters on education and employment outcomes in developed countries. The proposed methodology employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights. The quantitative component includes difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis and regression models to compare affected and unaffected regions before and after the disaster. This will help isolate the earthquake's impact on various outcomes of interest, such as graduation rates, enrollment patterns, and employment types. The qualitative aspect involves document analysis of policy reports and, if possible, interviews with education officials, school administrators, teachers, and students. Data collection draws from various Japanese government sources, including the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japan Meteorological Agency. The study also gather s information on educational statistics, labor market indicators, economic recovery metrics, demographic data, and disaster impact measures.

The research questions address several key areas: a) the impact on high school graduation rates and university enrollment patterns, b) short-term and medium-term effects on youth unemployment and types of employment, c) correlation between changes in educational attainment and shifts in employment patterns, d) effectiveness of policy measures implemented in response to the disaster, and e) changes in the popularity of specific university majors or vocational training programs. This study is expected to make significant academic contributions by filling gaps in our understanding of medium-term disaster impacts, analyzing differential impacts based on disaster intensity, and integrating education and labor market outcomes. It also aims to provide valuable insights for policy development in areas such as education system resilience, targeted intervention strategies, labor market policies, and long-term disaster recovery planning. The research is planned to be conducted during a short stay program at Tōhoku University, leveraging its location in Sendai, one of the areas significantly affected by the 2011 disaster. This positioning offers unique opportunities to gather firsthand insights and access local resources crucial to the study. By bridging the gap between immediate post-disaster studies and long-term impact assessments, this research seeks to provide crucial insights for enhancing societal resilience to natural disasters, particularly in the context of education and employment in developed countries prone to such catastrophic events.</p>
