        <h3>Cognitive and Noncognitive Factors in Educational Production</h3>
        <p>This is the first chapter of my thesis. It is pretty much still a work in progress, and preliminary results can be viewed <a href="Chapter_1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I keep a folder on <a href="https://github.com/BeaGietner/ConflictingForces" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with all the plots and graphs that I might end up adding to the final version.</p>
   <p>Abstract: This study investigates the combined impact of cognitive and noncognitive abilities on academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study, linear and translog production functions are applied to model these relationships. The findings show that cognitive abilities are the most influential predictors of academic performance across all students, with a slightly stronger correlation observed in male students. Noncognitive factors, particularly Focused Behavior and Conscientiousness, also play a significant role, especially for female students in Maths. The interaction between cognitive and noncognitive factors differs by subject: in Maths, they often complement each other, while in English, one can more easily compensate for the other. However, the ability of noncognitive skills to offset cognitive limitations has its limits, with behavioral skills providing greater flexibility than personality traits. The study also reveals diminishing returns in ability development, particularly in English. These results suggest that educational strategies that address both cognitive and noncognitive development, tailored to gender and subject-specific needs, may be more effective in narrowing academic achievement gaps. Additionally, the findings emphasize the need to consider whether noncognitive measures reflect changeable behaviors or more stable personality traits when designing educational interventions.</p>
