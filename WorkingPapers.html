        <h3>Conflicting Forces: The role of positive and negative mechanisms in shaping educational outcomes</h3>
        <p>This is the first chapter of my thesis. It is pretty much still a work in progress, and preliminary results can be viewed <a href="ConflictingForces.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I keep a folder on <a href="https://github.com/BeaGietner/ConflictingForces" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with all the plots and graphs that I might end up adding to the final version.</p>
   <p>Abstract: Much has been said about cognition's role in influencing children's and young adults' educational outcomes. However, there is a gap in the existing research regarding understanding the significance of noncognitive skills and behaviors in shaping these outcomes, especially when considering the variable gender. Although conclusions have been mixed, it is clear that multiple factors contribute to students' performance on standardized tests, educational achievements, and future job success. Using data from the comprehensive Growing Up In Ireland longitudinal study, I find that cognition is still the most important predictor of academic performance even when we consider different measures of noncognition and after controlling for observational characteristics. The effects, however, are not straightforward, with varying magnitudes for males and females. I then perform an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and find that while all cognitive measures are responsible, to different degrees, for closing the gender grade gap, noncognitive variables mostly widen the gap. This finding has significant implications for educational policies and interventions. I also find a high degree of heterogeneity when I break down cognition between genders for different scores of noncognitive variables, which shows that having high or low scores in noncognition can be favorable or detrimental depending on how individuals fare in cognition. This further underscores the need for targeted approaches. Furthermore, I model achievement as a production function with cognitive and noncognitive measures as inputs using the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (including the special case Cobb-Douglas and the extension Translog) form. When writing the achievement production function in the CES/Cobb-Douglas form, we observe decreasing returns to scale, and working with two inputs (one cognitive and one noncognitive) instead of three does not lead to major changes in the parameters. I also find that the inputs are imperfect substitutes, and that cognition has a much larger weight in the production function compared to noncognition. This means that a small change in cognition will significantly affect the outcome (achievement), while a change in noncognition will have a much smaller effect. Therefore, although the functional form suggests some degree of substitutability, the actual substitution effect is limited because cognition dominates the function. Overall, I find that cognition remains the dominant factor in educational achievement. The gender differences in noncognition, cognition (to a lesser degree), and the interaction between them largely explain the achievement gender gap. </div>
