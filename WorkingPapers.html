        <h3>Modeling the Gender Achievement Gap: Cognitive and Noncognitive Factors in Educational Production</h3>
        <p>This is the first chapter of my thesis. It is pretty much still a work in progress, and preliminary results can be viewed <a href="ConflictingForces.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I keep a folder on <a href="https://github.com/BeaGietner/ConflictingForces" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with all the plots and graphs that I might end up adding to the final version.</p>
   <p>Abstract: This study investigates the complex interplay between cognitive and noncognitive skills in shaping educational outcomes, with a particular focus on gender differences. Using comprehensive data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study, I employ multiple analytical approaches to examine the relative impacts of cognitive and noncognitive factors on academic performance. My findings consistently demonstrate that cognitive abilities remain the dominant predictor of academic achievement, even when accounting for various noncognitive measures and controlling for socioeconomic and school characteristics. However, the effects are not uniform across subjects or genders. Notably, I find that noncognitive skills, particularly those related to hyperactivity/inattention and conscientiousness, play a significant, albeit smaller, role in academic performance. Through Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, I reveal that while cognitive measures contribute to narrowing the gender achievement gap, noncognitive variables tend to widen it. This finding emphasizes  the need for targeted educational interventions that consider both cognitive and noncognitive dimensions.
My analysis further uncovers substantial heterogeneity in the interaction between cognitive and noncognitive abilities across different performance levels, suggesting that the impact of noncognitive skills varies depending on a student's cognitive abilities. This complexity is further illustrated through production function modeling, where I find evidence of imperfect substitutability between cognitive and noncognitive inputs in educational achievement. Using Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) and translog production functions, I demonstrate decreasing returns to scale in educational production and confirm the dominant role of cognition. However, I also find that noncognitive factors, while less influential, still play a meaningful role in academic outcomes.
These findings have significant implications for educational policy and practice, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach that addresses both cognitive and noncognitive skill development, while recognizing their complex interactions and gender-specific impacts.</p>
