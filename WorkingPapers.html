        <h3>Modeling the Gender Achievement Gap: Cognitive and Noncognitive Factors in Educational Production</h3>
        <p>This is the first chapter of my thesis. It is pretty much still a work in progress, and preliminary results can be viewed <a href="ConflictingForces.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I keep a folder on <a href="https://github.com/BeaGietner/ConflictingForces" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with all the plots and graphs that I might end up adding to the final version.</p>
   <p>Abstract: This study examines how cognitive and noncognitive skills affect educational outcomes,
       while focusing on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study, I apply various 
       analytical methods to assess these factors’ impacts on academic performance. My findings repeatedly show 
       cognition as the main predictor
of academic achievement, even when considering noncognition and controlling for
socioeconomic and school factors. However, effects vary widely in size and sign
across subjects and genders. Noncognitive skills, especially Hyperactivity/Inattention
       and Conscientiousness, play a significant but smaller role. The Oaxaca-Blinder
decomposition reveals cognition narrows the gender achievement gap, while noncognition widens it.
       I find heterogeneity in cognitive-noncognitive interactions across performance levels, and imperfect 
       substitutability between them as inputs. Using Cobb-Douglas and Translog production functions, 
       I show decreasing returns to scale in education and confirm cognition’s dominant role, while noncognitive
       factors remain meaningful. The Translog model indicates a subtle substitutive relationship between cognitive 
       and noncognitive skills. These findings suggest the need for nuanced educational approaches addressing 
       both skill types while considering their complex interactions and gender-specific impacts.
