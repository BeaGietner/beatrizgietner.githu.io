            <h2>Master's Dissertation</h2>
            <p>
                You can download my Master's dissertation 
                <a href="Dissertation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 
                I wrote about how the GFC altered Leaving Cert (the Irish national entrance exam to third-level education) candidates' choice of majors. I found a significant gender gap in STEM subjects and varied trends in student participation. There was an increase in students taking Agricultural Science, Applied Mathematics, Biology, and Chemistry, but a decrease in those taking Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and Physics and Chemistry. Additionally, admission points for STEM-related college courses, especially in Healthcare, Chemistry, Nanotechnology, Biology, and Computer Science, saw a notable rise.

            <h2>Making a Miracle? A Literature Review on the Economic Determinants That Shaped East Asia in the 20th Century</h2>
            <p>
                I wrote this for our Macro II's final project, and some people on Reddit seemed to like it, so 
                <a href="lit_review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> it is.

            <h2>Applying Kuhnâ€™s Concept of Scientific Revolutions to the History of Wave-Particle Duality</h2>
            <p>
                In 
                <a href="kuhn.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> essay, I explore the nature of light and its historical discussions, emphasizing the importance of studying both philosophy and the history of science. I highlight Thomas Kuhn's contributions to understanding how scientific communities function and apply aspects of scientific revolutions to the wave-particle duality period. In the end, I agree with Kuhn's notion that significant scientific progress often requires a commitment that risks being wrong. Despite the uncertainties faced by scientists in the past, the study of light's dual nature has led to remarkable technological advancements. I suggest that even if humanity still doesn't fully understand light, the benefits derived from its study make the pursuit worthwhile.

            <h2>With Students Like These, Who Needs the Nanny-State?</h2>
            <p>
                I wrote an article for <em>The Times</em> (UK) a few years ago about the notion of a nanny-state. Social scientists keep referencing it, so I thought about adding it

            <h2>Building a K-Community: Idol Stars Challenging Foreign Fans to Learn Korean Traditions</h2>
            <p>
                My fascination with Chinese and Korean cultures led me to assist Professor Saeji from Pusan University in Korea. I translated her research materials into Portuguese and assisted with data analysis for her paper, which can be found
