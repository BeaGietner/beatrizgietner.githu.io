        <h3>Master's dissertation</h3>
        <p>You can download my Master's dissertation <a href="Dissertation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I wrote about how the GFC altered Leaving Cert (the Irish national entrance exam to third-level education) candidates' choice of majors. </p>
        <p>I found a significant gender gap in STEM subjects and varied trends in student participation. There was an increase in students taking Agricultural Science, Applied Mathematics, Biology, and Chemistry, but a decrease in those taking Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and Physics and Chemistry. Additionally, admission points for STEM-related college courses, especially in Healthcare, Chemistry, Nanotechnology, Biology, and Computer Science, saw a notable rise.</p>
    <h3>With students like these, who needs the nanny-state?</h3>
        <p>I wrote an article for The Times (UK) a few years ago about the notion of a nanny-state. Social scientists keep referencing it, so I thought about adding it <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/with-students-like-this-who-needs-the-nanny-state-fbnrgljrm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
   <h3>Building a K-Community: Idol stars challenging foreign fans to learn Korean traditions</h3>
        <p>My fascination with Chinese and Korean cultures led me to assist Professor Saeji from Pusan University in Korea. I translated her research materials into Portuguese and assisted with data analysis for her paper, which can be found <a href="https://newcms.kmu.ac.kr/dext5editordata/2022/12/20221215_110549903_83633.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
 <h3>Making a miracle? A literature review on the economic determinants that shaped East Asia in the 20th century.</h3>
   <p>I wrote this for the final project for Macro II, and some people on Reddit seemed to like it, so <a href="lit_review.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> it is. </p>
